# Deadly Earthquakes
Analysis of deadly earthquakes and correlation with other natural features to predict where deadly earthquakes are most likely to occur

The ability to know when and where deadly earthquakes will occur would be hugely valuable but has so far eluded prediction. This is largely due to the inability to separate the signal from the noise in the data. This was â€¦ In our data science bootcamp we were given a wikipedia page listing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deadly_earthquakes_since_1900" target="_blank">deadly earthquakes since 1990</a> and asked to identify any trends or insights that could help predict when and where future deadly earthquakes may occur. The obvious difficulty with this problem is that the data are very noisy and not very extensive, making it hard to form any predictions with a reasonable degree of certainty. 
	To get the data we used BeautifulSoup (https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to scrape the wikipedia page and convert to a pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.22.0/) dataframe. We then used regex (https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html) to clean the data and then converted dtypes to appropriate formats. There were a number of fields with missing data and for some of them we were able to manually input the information. For columns that many missing values we either removed the column or only focused on rows where all data were complete. We also simplified fields that calculated total deaths differently by selecting the largest value across all death calculations. 
	At this point we supplemented our main data by finding other sources with information that may be relevant to when and where deadly earthquakes occur, specifically data about volcanoes (http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/volcano_table), deep sea vents (http://vents-data.interridge.org/ventfields_list_all), and tectonic plate boundaries (https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates). We then used geopandas (http://geopandas.org/) to overlay the data points over a world map (link to map). We were able to see trends but needed to quantify the relationship with earthquakes.
	We calculated the nearest of each of our new features using numpy (http://www.numpy.org/) and used that to visualize the trends of the nearest volcano and tectonic boundary type using matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/). 
	With all this information we train a supervised machine learning model of where deadly earthquakes occur. We then tested the ability of the model to predict earthquakes which occur in areas where fracking is performed (Oklahoma and northern Texas) (link). We found that the model was not able to predict earthquakes that occurred in this area, possibly indicating that earthquakes associated with fracking occur due to factors beyond natural ones. The model likely needs to be tuned to ensure no overfitting has occurred. This process was also repeated on a more extensive list of earthquakes (link), not just deadly ones, and a similar trend was observed.
	skills: Webscraping, combining multiple data sets, plotting geodata, calculating minimum distance with numpy, train supervised machine learning model to suggest earthquakes in areas where fracking occurs is unlikely due to natural causes
